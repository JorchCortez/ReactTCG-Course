# React TCG Course
This project will be holding the information about the progress I get and some personal notes during the React the complete guide course, it is the 3rd time I take it but I feel I need  a quick recap to the whole thing before I jump into work on The "[Make The Campaign](https://github.com/JorchCortez)" Project which is the project I'm thinking about working on during the first half of this year, for more info on it go to the repo's readme linked in the project's name.

### ðŸ¤” How does it work?
"[React The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wby3@fD0HMF6FMFZkKlb94peOViIMwmsMyVS8rrPX6HL6kaQ4RKxJaSDq1vQ_Wl-PfDB5/)" Is a pretty amazing and super complete React course made by **Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller** this course is held in Udemy and it is pretty cheap for a course as updated as this so I'll be working with it for now as I have done before. this time though I'll be ordering my code in a bit of a better way (this way will be this repo btw)

### ðŸ¤“Why am I re doing the course ?
Well this is due to a couple of reasons:
- I haven't worked with react as is for about 5 months
- The course got updated later last year including a fully rework with all new React js features ðŸ¤©
- I want to remember how to do things good from the start before I start working in my next project...
- --- 
So that is pretty much it for how I'll be working with the course and why now I'll be writing info about each project from the course and my personal notes about it as well.


### Project  #1 - Expense tracker
The Expense Tracker app, first app of the course makes use of the following:
- Custom components
- Container components
- useState() Hook
- Events
- Forms

### Project  #2 - Task tracker
The Task Tracker app, second app of the course was pretty much the same as the first one but was focusing more on the different ways to style components.

### Project #3 - Form with input validation
Simple form with input validation, not anything fancy just... a form that validates user input
